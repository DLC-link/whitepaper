## How to edit this document (on Mac)

 - First clone this repo to your machine.

Follow the instructions on setting up MacTex and VSCode from this guide:

https://mathjiajia.github.io/vscode-and-latex/

### TLDR:
 - Download and install MacTex: [Download link for Mac, note it's 4.96 Gb](https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/mac/mactex/MacTeX.pkg)
 - Search for and Install `LaTeX Workshop` Extension for VSCode
 - If setup is successful, you can start editing `dlc-link.tex`, and you can open the preview window to see your changes take place live (see guide screenshot)
 - It will recompile on every save

## Things to note about Latex

 - Special Symbols (for example `~` `$` `%` etc.) have to be escaped using the `\` character, see examples in current doc
 - Most symbols have prettier typefaces when inserted specially, see e.g. `tm` superscript inserted using `\textsuperscript{TM}`, or [take a look at these](https://www.stevesque.com/symbols/)
 - Learn latex: https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes and https://wch.github.io/latexsheet/
 - `ChatGPT` is really good at Latex

It can be tiresome to edit documents this way, but the result is totally worth it.
